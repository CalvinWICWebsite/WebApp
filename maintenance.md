### Edit Calendar Events
To edit the events calendar, all you need to do is edit the Google calendar for wicwebapp@gmail.com.

### Edit Leadership Cars
All of the leadership cards are hard coded in the html file. In ../app/pages/leadership/leadership.component.html you will see each of the card components hard coded. You can add, delete, or edit the information in the correct corresponding tag that you need to update. All of the pictures for the leadership card can be stored and accessed in ../src/assets.

### Edit the pdf Links
All of the pdfs are stored in this repo [here](https://github.com/CalvinWICWebsite/pdfs). You can add, delete, or edit the pdfs found in this repo to your liking. If you edit a pdf, just make sure that when you push it to the repo, the name matches the name in your html code.
