# Women in Computing Website
## 336 Final Project
### Emily Costa | Sinai Park | Sebene Yi

For our final project, we are creating a website for the Women in Computing Club. This will provide one central location where you can learn about WIC, meet the leadership team, and also sign up. Our main goal is to improve convenience and efficiency when potential or current members are looking for information regarding our club and events.

The website will have a simple and user-friendly layout. A custom component will be used for an info card on each member of the leadership, along with a short description and a picture. On the webpage, we will utilize Instagram’s API to display a live feed, have event postings, and a membership sign up. In addition, there will be a mentor/mentee sign up for WIC’s mentorship program to make it easier for people to sign up throughout the year.
