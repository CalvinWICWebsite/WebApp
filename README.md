This is the most updated version of WIC's website by Emily Costa. This web applicaiton was developed using Angular's framework.

The first version of WIC's website was made by Emily Costa, Sinai Park (sp46), and Sebene Yi (ssy3). [Project Repo](https://github.com/cs336-wic/web-app).

The main changes are that the leadership cards are now hard coded instead of using Cloud Firestore, for easier maintenance. Version 2 no logner uses Angular's calendar compponent. Instead, Goodle calender is embedded into the web app, also for easier maintenance.
